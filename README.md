# Express.js Route Handling: 204 vs. 404 for Empty Result Sets

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handling: choosing the correct HTTP status code when a database query returns no results.

The `bug.js` file shows incorrect handling, while `bugSolution.js` presents the correct approach.

## The Problem

When a database query for a specific resource (e.g., a user with a given ID) returns nothing, it's natural to return a 404 (Not Found) status. However, when querying for a list of resources (e.g., all users) and finding none, a 204 (No Content) response is more appropriate.  The `bug.js` file incorrectly uses 404 in the latter scenario.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the correct way to handle both scenarios.  It uses 404 when a single resource is not found and 204 when a list of resources is empty.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` (to see the incorrect behavior) and `node bugSolution.js` (to see the correct behavior).
